# MA-346-Final-Project1 

We used a dataset from GitHub containing the value, tax assessment, and features of about 5,000 homes in West Roxbury, MA (a neighborhood in Boston). The data was collected in 2018. The technique from class we chose to apply was machine learning. Our goal was to be able to predict the value of a home using some or all of its remaining data.
